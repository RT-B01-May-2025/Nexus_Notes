# üì¶ What is an Artifact Registry?

An **Artifact Registry** is a **managed service or system** used to store and serve **build artifacts**, such as:

- Docker images
- JAR/WAR files
- npm packages
- Python packages
- Helm charts
- Other compiled binaries (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz)

It serves as a **central location** for versioned, secure, and repeatable deployments in CI/CD pipelines.

# üì¶ What is a Repository in a Registry?

In the context of an **Artifact Registry** (such as Docker Hub, Nexus, Artifactory, or Google Artifact Registry), a **repository** is a **logical namespace** used to organize and store **artifacts** (like Docker images, JARs, npm packages, etc.).

---

## üß± Analogy

- **Registry** ‚Üí A library
- **Repository** ‚Üí A bookshelf in that library
- **Artifact** ‚Üí A book on the shelf

---

## üîç Definition

> A **repository** in a registry is a collection of versioned artifacts grouped by project, type, or use case.

---

## üìÇ Types of Repositories

| Repository Type     | Artifact Format     | Example Artifacts                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Docker**          | Docker images       | `myapp:1.0`, `nginx:latest`            |
| **Maven**           | Java JAR/WAR files  | `com.example:my-app:1.0.0`             |
| **npm**             | Node.js packages    | `@myorg/utils@1.2.3`                   |
| **PyPI**            | Python packages     | `requests-2.28.1-py3-none-any.whl`     |
| **Helm**            | Helm charts         | `nginx-chart-1.0.0.tgz`                |

## üîê Repository Roles in a Registry

- Logical **grouping** of artifacts
- Fine-grained **access control** (RBAC)
- **Versioning** and artifact lifecycle management
- Support for **promotion flows** (dev ‚Üí stage ‚Üí prod)

## üß∞ Real-world Examples

### Google Artifact Registry
```
Location: asia-south1
Registry: my-project-docker
Repository: backend-api
Artifact: backend-api:1.0.2
```

### Docker Hub
```
Registry: docker.io
Repository: myusername/myapp
Tags: latest, v1.0, v1.1
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

- A **repository** is a storage unit **within a registry** for organizing, storing, and versioning build artifacts.
- Each repository is usually tied to:
  - A **format** (Docker, Maven, npm, etc.)
  - A **purpose/project/team**
  - Specific **access permissions**
